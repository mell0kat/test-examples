# test-examples

A repository for example test code.

This is a (very) simple fullstack web app with react and redux, it has front and back end tests using Jest and Enzyme. Hopefully over time we can build up a good amount of code examples that will make test writing quick for our new projects.

### Instructions

After cloning the Repo

* run `npm install`

* run `npm test`

you can also try building the repo with `npm run dev` or `npm run prod` (smaller bundle, no sourcemap) and take a look at some of the behavior.
